# ClickDocInator
The "ClickDocInator" is a modern alternative to the now-deprecated PSR.exe tool, offering enhanced functionality and ease of use. Designed to document user actions with precision, this application captures screenshots and metadata of every step, making it ideal for troubleshooting, tutorials, and documentation. Unlike PSR.exe, "ClickDocInator" saves changes in real-time to prevent data loss, ensuring that all information is securely preserved as you work.

The release binaries are large because they have .net8 included so no extra download is needed and can be run as non-admin (portable)
